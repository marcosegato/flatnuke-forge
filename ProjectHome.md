# What is Flatnuke Forge #
This project aims to become the best _high-quality_ code repository for [Flatnuke](http://flatnuke.org/), a PHP flat CMS that makes no use of DBMS. Our guide lines are:
  * coding standard to make the code homogeneous, because reading code is hard enough
  * KISS and DRY:
    1. "Keep It Simple Stupid", do what is required and no more
    1. "Don't Repeat Yourself", avoid duplicating code; the less code you write, the less bugs you write
  * good documentation is an advertisement for the quality of our code
  * english required
If you'd like to start a new project here, to share with other developers your ideas, or to improve your experience in Flatnuke coding, feel free to contact [us](mailto:marco.segato@gmail.com) or do subscribe to [flatnuke-devel group](http://groups.google.com/group/Flatnuke-devel).
